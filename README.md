### Hello folks! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Sarath**](https://sarathnadavalur.github.io/my-website/), a software engineer from Toronto, Canada.

I'm primarily interested in **full-stack development** and currently work as a
software engineer at 8x8 International. ðŸ“Œ Previously, I was at L&T TS.

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services. I have contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also play a lot of PC games.
